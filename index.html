Hi, my name is Jeremiah Morris-Wyley, Welcome to my portfolio page! I'm excited to dive deeper into Digital Humanities and plan to showcase my work here throughout the semester.
I'm currently in my final year at UCF, majoring in Digital Media with a focus on the Web & Social Platforms track. My background includes experience in web design and some mobile development.
I hope you enjoy exploring my projects this semester!
