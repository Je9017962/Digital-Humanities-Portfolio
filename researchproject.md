# My Final Research Project  

This is a big project, and you definitely want a place to show it off! Here's a suggested layout for that (but feel free to display your work however you prefer).
You can link to your project here, or embed it.
If it is easier to embed your project in an HTML file, just change the .md on this one to .html, and write in HTML! (Be sure to update the links to this page to reflect the new name though!)

How AI is Changing Web Design and the Way Websites Share Information

What happens when machines also start designing the digital spaces we collectively inhabit? This project explores how artificial intelligence is transforming web design and development, beyond the technical ramifications, concerned with its ethical, creative, and communicative implications. As AI becomes more ingrained in design processes, concerns of authorship, accessibility, and information clarity online come to the fore. Both designers, students, and end-users are affected by how automation alters layout and UX design, and by how it determines the personalization of information. To analyze these shifts, a Twine-based interactive narrative was developed to simulate the influence of AI-based decision-making on design, usability, and context. This branching approach to design enables the visualization of how AI systems, such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the Many CSS generator, which uses machine learning to determine layout and styling axes, can alter components in real-time based on user behavior and contextual data. While research shows that AI can decrease development time and amid some technical barriers, it also can lead to increased bias, transparency questions, and control-related concerns. One study found that “code-generating AI isn’t sophisticated enough to generate systems from scratch without bugs and security concerns” (Lindström & Nilsson), emphasizing the continued need for human oversight. Other sources highlight how AI can dynamically adjust design elements based on user behavior, improving clarity and responsiveness (Muthazhagu; Zhang et al.). Ethical concerns such as bias, transparency, and the erosion of creative authorship also emerged as key themes (Almusharraf & Almusharraf; Sundararajan & Sundararajan). Ultimately, the research explains that AI is not just a technical tool but also a cultural force altering the way that digital experiences are understood and generated. Therefore, designers can use these tools to reflect upon the ethical implications of automated tools and draw audiences to consider how intelligent systems match our ability to communicate on the web.
