  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming web design, with a focus on automated code generation. As traditional coding methods struggle to match modern interface needs, artificial intelligence (AI) provides new alternatives by translating design inputs into functioning web code.The report examines key approaches, datasets, and algorithms to show AI's rising significance in impacting both present practices and future advances in web development.  
    It also looks at historical patterns, case studies, and ethical issues to provide a full picture of this evolving discipline. </p>
