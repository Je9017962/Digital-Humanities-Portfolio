# Distant Reading Assignment 

I used Voyant to search this website! [Digitala Vetenskapliga Arkivet!](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1769082&dswid=-7566)

I learned about the process and wheiter it was possible or not to create fully developed websites using AI.

I also tried Copilot, I did not use the new ChatGPT-5. Here's our conversation.

I learned that it can produce a summary of the provided text.

I learned it can provide what information is accurate and what can not be verified.

The method I used to summarize the results of the text I provided can be broken down into two distinct approaches. The first was through Voyage, which helped me visualize the text more effectively. By using different colors to separate key topics, Voyage allowed me to see how each idea connected to the others, making the overall structure of the content easier to understand. This visual breakdown clarified the relationships between concepts and helped me organize my thoughts more clearly. The second approach was through Copilot, which provided verified and factual information that I could trust and cross-reference. Copilot offered insights that were not only relevant to my topic but also backed by sources I could revisit for further research. This added a layer of credibility to my summary and gave me confidence in the accuracy of the information I was using. Copilotâ€™s ability to synthesize complex ideas and present them in a clear, digestible format made it easier for me to understand and communicate the core message of the text.
